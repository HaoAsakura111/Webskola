		<p>That's why it changed its name: to reflect its goal of expanding into what will succeed the modern-day
			internet. Zuckerberg has said it never made sense anyway for the company, which houses multiple projects and
			apps, to go by one of their names (Facebook.)

			And if that move sounds familiar, it's because that's how Google restructured itself in 2015 to allow each
			of its businesses to operate more efficiently.</p>

		<p>When Alphabet stood up, Google and its "Other Bets" endeavors — devoted to futuristic tech — were split into
			two buckets and housed under that umbrella. The latter included the Waymo self-driving car initiative and
			Loon, slated to transform
			broadband
			access with solar-powered hot air balloons.</p>

		<p>But in the six years since, Google has moved at a glacial pace to drive some of its "moonshot projects" into
			mainstream use, as CNBC recently noted. While some have shown promise, others have been reabsorbed into
			Google, sunk loads of cash, spun off as separate entities, or been shuttered altogether.

			And as Meta gears up to pour billions into its metaverse mission over the years, "we're seeing history
			repeat itself," Whitney Tilson, a former hedge-fund manager and the CEO of Empire Financial Research, told
			Insider.</p>
